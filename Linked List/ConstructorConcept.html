    <h1>Here we are going to learn about constructor</h1>
    <h2>constructor are nothing but a function</h2>
    <h1>We use constructor to create objects by own</h1>
    <h2>we will give a protype and then constructor will create abject basis on the prototype</h2>
</br>
</br>
    <h1>Now here we are going to ask our constructor to add a method just when you are creating  new room for anyone</h1>

</body>
<script>
    // here we are making prototype
    var createRoom= function(name){
        this.table=`${name} table`
    }
    // above and below are the same things above we are storing function in a variable and below we are creating a normal function
    function createRoom(){
        this.table=`${name} table`
    }
    // here we are making new house for john by using prototype
   var johnHouse= new createRoom("john")
   console.log(johnHouse.table);
   // here we are  making a function and then we will call it for john's room with using call function
   function cleanTable(tablename){
    console.log("cleaning ",tablename, this.table);
   }
   // called function using call method and here john's is variable passed and this. table is referring to 
   // johntable .this
   cleanTable.call(this.johnHouse,"john's")
   // here we are going to call function inside johnroom without using the call function

   // here we will ask constructor to create a method along with creating new function so
   // we will not need to create new function for everyone and also 
   // we will no longer need to use this calll method it will be automatically inserted in it
   // so we only need to call it normally
   createRoom.prototype.cleanTable =function cleanTable(tablename){ // here we are creating a protype function named clearntable or we can say a vairable which have...

    console.log("cleaning ",tablename, this.table); // here we have contents of function
   } 
   johnHouse.cleanTable("johnny reoom")
   // again creating one more room for jills
   var jillsRoom= new createRoom("Jills")
   console.log(jillsRoom.table);
